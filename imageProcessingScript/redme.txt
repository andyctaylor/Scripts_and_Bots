# Image Processing with Pillow

# Description

This repository will house an evolving image processing script built using the Python Pillow (PIL) library. As I develop the script, I'll document features and updates directly within this README.

# Motivation

Exploring Pillow: Delve into the capabilities of the powerful Pillow image processing library.
Practical Application: Create a functional script to solve real-world image manipulation tasks.
Knowledge Sharing: Track my progress and share insights with those interested in Pillow and image processing.
