Project Title: Scripting Apps Collection


# Description

This repository serves as a central hub for a collection of free and open-source scripting applications I develop. I primarily use Python 3 to create these apps, which aim to solve  various tasks and streamline workflows.  Each app is housed within its own folder, complete with a detailed README outlining its specific purpose, dependencies, and usage instructions.


# Motivation

Skill Development: This project allows me to continuously hone my Python programming abilities while tackling practical problems.
Community Contribution: I believe in the power of open-source software and am committed to sharing my creations with others for potential use, improvement, or inspiration.
Portfolio Showcase: This repository offers a snapshot of my technical capabilities, demonstrating my coding style and problem-solving approaches.


# Current Apps

1. Image converter (https://github.com/andyctaylor/Scripts_and_Bots/tree/main/imageProcessingScript):
This script converts any image file to a png format.

2. Password Security Checker: Proactively protect your accounts by checking if your passwords have 
been exposed in data breaches.

More apps will be added as they are developed!
